> **Note**
> This is a work-in-progress document. Get in touch if you want to contribute.


## What to Add in your Informed Consent Form?
You should begin by providing a simple, non-technical explanation of the physiological data collection procedure to participants, emphasizing its purpose in the research study. Participants need to be informed that various sensors or devices may be used to collect physiological signals such as heart rate, respiration, or other relevant data. It should be made clear that the data collected is solely for research purposes and that any irrelevant information will not be observed or analysed by the researchers. Additionally, participants should be notified of the potential risks associated with the data collection procedure to ensure their safety and well-being. Providing a link to professional guidance for any concerns related to their health or well-being is essential.

Here are templates of the information that should be included for different types of signals:

- [**Cardiac Activity (ECG, PPG)**](https://github.com/RealityBending/SussexPhysioProtocol/blob/main/ECG.md#informed-consent-form)



| About EEG| 
| --- |
| EEG (Electroencephalography) is a method of recording electrical activity in the brain, providing an electrogram representation of brain waves. This is achieved by placing electrodes around the head to measure electrical conductance. In our study, we will be using electrodes on the forehead and behind the ears to capture the electrogram from two different sites. In some cases, a slightly damp cloth may be used to increase conductance and improve the quality of the recorded data. <br/><br/> To measure EEG, we will utilize the Muse 2 headset. Although this headset is commercially available for meditation purposes, it will be used exclusively for research in our study. Therefore, we will not be able to provide feedback or information on clinical aspects of the data obtained. The Muse 2 headset is lightweight and non-intrusive, ensuring a comfortable experience during the recording session. If you have long hair, we recommend bringing a hairband to ensure unobstructed contact between the electrodes and your skin.|

## What to Add in your Ethics Application?

### Risk Assessment Form

A risk assessment form should be included in your ethical review, listing all potential risks and explaining in detail who might be at risk and how to properly control those risks. 

A list of the University of Sussex risk assessment forms can be found here: 
https://www.sussex.ac.uk/hso/hsoatoz

#### ECG

With disposable electrodes, the main "risk" is that of an allergic reaction towards the adhesive materials present in the electrode pads. Though very rare, please ensure to identify and address this risk in your study. 

Here is an example of risk assessment that you should include:

| Hazards & Controls | 
| --- |
| **Potential hazards:** Allergic reaction to electrodes <br/><br/> **Who might be harmed and how:** Participants, dermatitis caused by the allergic reaction from the electrodes <br/><br/> **What current controls are in place to avoid harm:** Participants will be asked before the placement of the electrodes if they had negative experience in the past with similar equipment. Additionally, the researcher will monitor potential discomfort or skin redness after the placement of the first electrode and remove everything if any suspicion arises <br/><br/> **What further control measures are required to reduce risk:** N/A <br/><br/> **Who will do this:** Researchers and participants <br/><br/> **When must this be done:** During the study <br/><br/> **Completed on:** N/A|

### Statements

Apart from describing the tasks that participants will conduct during the experiment (under the METHOD section for ethical review made at the University of Sussex), it is important to provide a detailed explanation of the physiological measurement procedure. This should include information such as:

- [x] **Brand** of the equipment used with link to its website
- [x] **Setup** of the equipment (e.g., electrodes placement)
- [x] **Training** for the researchers
- [x] **Instructions** for participants during setup and recording
- [x] **Safety** procedures

Additionally, it is crucial to state in your ethical application that all manufacturer instructions will be strictly followed.

Here is an example of the information that should be added to the experimental design for an ECG study:

| ECG Recording | 
| --- |
| Cardiac activity will be collected through a BITalino device via ECG, with disposable electrodes placed on the collarbones and above the hipbone (or alternatively, using a fingertip sensor for PPG if the former is not possible). These non-invasive surface physiological measures will be employed. The researchers will receive proper training to handle the equipment and ensure participants' comfort and safety during the setup and recording process.<br/><br/> Participants will be provided with instructions prior to the experiment regarding the electrode placement on their collarbones and above the hip. They will also be advised to wear loose and comfortable clothing. Upon the placement of the first electrode, researchers will carefully observe and inquire about any signs of potential allergic reactions, such as redness or discomfort. If any such reactions occur, the device will be promptly removed, and alternative measures will be implemented (e.g., pulse measurement via fingertip PPG).<br/><br/> During data collection, strict adherence to all manufacturer instructions will be maintained. Brand-new electrodes will be used for each participant to ensure accurate signal quality. After the session, electrodes will be promptly disposed of in accordance with recommended guidelines, ensuring participant safety and maintaining stringent hygiene standards. |

| EEG Recording | 
| --- |
|Electroencephalography (EEG) will be conducted using the Muse 2 headset, a lightweight and non-intrusive device. The headset is designed to be worn comfortably behind the ears and on the forehead, utilizing four electrodes to capture electrical signals from the brain's temporal and frontal lobes. Specifically, the four channels (TP9, TP19, AF7, and AF8) will be recorded using dry electrodes placed at these sites. <br/><br/> The Muse 2 headset is a commercially available device commonly used for capturing meditation biomarkers, and it poses no risk or harm to the participants. It employs non-invasive dry electrodes, ensuring a safe and comfortable data collection experience. In rare instances where the received signal is too weak to be useful, researchers may enhance skin conductance by gently rubbing a slightly damp cloth across the forehead and behind the ears. However, this step is typically unnecessary and, if needed, can be performed by the participants themselves. <br/><br/> Following data collection, the researcher will collect the Muse 2 headset and sanitize it appropriately before its subsequent use. These measures ensure the maintenance of hygiene standards and the participants' well-being throughout the research process. |
