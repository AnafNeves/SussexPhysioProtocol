*Guidelines for best practices in psychophysiological research.*

This document contains information to help you include physiological data in your experiments. Feel free to borrow, edit, improve, and do [let us know](https://github.com/RealityBending/SussexPhysioProtocol/issues) if you have questions or suggestions.

## What to add in your Inform Consent form?
You should begin by providing a simple, non-technical explanation of the physiological data collection procedure to participants, emphasizing its purpose in the research study. Participants need to be informed that various sensors or devices may be used to collect physiological signals such as heart rate, respiration, or other relevant data. It should be made clear that the data collected is solely for research purposes and that any irrelevant information will not be observed or analysed by the researchers. Additionally, participants should be notified of the potential risks associated with the data collection procedure to ensure their safety and well-being. Providing a link to professional guidance for any concerns related to their health or well-being is essential.

Here is a template of the information that should be included in the UK version of the information sheet for an electrocardiogram (ECG) study:

### ABOUT ECG

*The ECG is a simple procedure where sensors are attached to the skin to detect the electrical signals produced by your heart each time it beats. The ECG we use is intended for use in life science education and research and is not a medical device. The study is being undertaken for research purposes only, and the researchers will not be able to provide any feedback regarding your ECG following participation. If you have any concerns about your heart and/or related health issues, you should contact your GP. Further information about ECG is available on the NHS website: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/electrocardiogram/*

### PARTICIPANT ADVISORY: SKIN SENSITIVITY TO ELECTRODE MATERIALS

*We kindly request that participants refrain from volunteering for the study if they are aware of having sensitive skin to adhesives or the materials used in the electrodes. The electrodes used in the study are primarily composed of silver and silver chloride. If you have experienced skin reactions or allergies to these materials in the past, we advise against participation. Your comfort and well-being are our top priorities, and we appreciate your understanding in ensuring a safe and suitable research environment.*

*Please note that the template is for reference purposes only and should be adapted to fit the specific requirements of each study.
