*Guidelines for best practices in psychophysiological research.*

This document contains information to help you include physiological data in your experiments. Feel free to borrow, edit, improve, and do [let us know](https://github.com/RealityBending/SussexPhysioProtocol/issues) if you have questions or suggestions.

## What to add in your Inform Consent form?
You should begin by providing a simple, non-technical explanation of the physiological data collection procedure to participants, emphasizing its purpose in the research study. Participants need to be informed that various sensors or devices may be used to collect physiological signals such as heart rate, respiration, or other relevant data. It should be made clear that the data collected is solely for research purposes and that any irrelevant information will not be observed or analysed by the researchers. Additionally, participants should be notified of the potential risks associated with the data collection procedure to ensure their safety and well-being. Providing a link to professional guidance for any concerns related to their health or well-being is essential.

Here is a template of the information that should be included in the UK version of the information sheet for an electrocardiogram (ECG) study:

### ABOUT ECG

*The ECG is a simple procedure where sensors are attached to the skin to detect the electrical signals produced by your heart each time it beats. The ECG we use is intended for use in life science education and research and is not a medical device. The study is being undertaken for research purposes only, and the researchers will not be able to provide any feedback regarding your ECG following participation. If you have any concerns about your heart and/or related health issues, you should contact your GP. Further information about ECG is available on the NHS website: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/electrocardiogram/*

***Advisory: Skin sensitivity to electrodes.*** *We kindly request that participants refrain from volunteering for the study if they are aware of having sensitive skin to adhesives or the materials used in the electrodes. The electrodes used in the study are primarily composed of silver and silver chloride. If you have experienced skin reactions or allergies to these materials in the past, we advise against participation. Your comfort and well-being are our top priorities, and we appreciate your understanding in ensuring a safe and suitable research environment.*

*Please note that the template is for reference purposes only and should be adapted to fit the specific requirements of each study.


## What to add in your Ethics Application?

### Risk assessment form

A risk assessment form should be included in your ethical review, listing all potential risks and explaining in detail who might be at risk and how to properly control those risks. It is important to note that participants in your study will need to read and sign the form. This ensures that they are aware of the potential risks involved and that they acknowledge their understanding of the safety measures and procedures outlined in the assessment.

### User manual

Regardless of the type of physiological data you will be collecting for the study, it is essential to include the corresponding user manual provided by the manufacturer, which can be found online.

### Statements

Apart from describing the tasks that participants will conduct during the experiment (under the METHOD section for ethical review made at the University of Sussex), it is important to provide a detailed explanation of the physiological measurement procedure. This should include information such as the brand of the equipment used, the setup of the equipment, proper training for the researchers, participant instructions, alternative approaches, and safety procedures. Additionally, it is crucial to state in your ethical application that all manufacturer instructions will be strictly followed.

Here is a template of the information that should be added to the experimental design for an ECG study:

*Cardiac activity will be collected through a BITalino device via ECG, with disposable electrodes placed on the collarbones and above the hipbone (or alternatively, using a fingertip sensor for PPG if the former is not possible). These non-invasive surface physiological measures will be employed. The researchers will receive proper training to handle the equipment and ensure participants' comfort and safety during the setup and recording process.*

*Participants will be provided with instructions prior to the experiment regarding the electrode placement on their collarbones and above the hip. They will also be advised to wear loose and comfortable clothing. Upon the placement of the first electrode, researchers will carefully observe and inquire about any signs of potential allergic reactions, such as redness or discomfort. If any such reactions occur, the device will be promptly removed, and alternative measures will be implemented (e.g., pulse measurement via fingertip PPG).*

*During data collection, strict adherence to all manufacturer instructions will be maintained. Brand-new electrodes will be used for each participant to ensure accurate signal quality. After the session, electrodes will be promptly disposed of in accordance with recommended guidelines, ensuring participant safety and maintaining stringent hygiene standards."*
