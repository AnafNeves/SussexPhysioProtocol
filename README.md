*Guidelines for best practices in psychophysiological research.*

## What to add in your Inform Consent form?
You should begin by providing a simple, non-technical explanation of the ECG procedure to participants, emphasizing that its purpose is solely to collect data for research. Participants need to be informed that any information unrelated to the study objectives will not be observed or analysed by the researchers. It is crucial to communicate the potential risk of allergic reactions resulting from the materials used in the ECG electrodes to prevent any physical harm. Additionally, participants should be provided with a link to seek professional guidance for any concerns they may have regarding their heart health or related issues.

Here is a template of the information that should be included in the UK version of the information sheet:

*ABOUT ECG*

*The ECG is a simple procedure where sensors are attached to the skin to detect the electrical signals produced by your heart each time it beats. The ECG we use is intended for use in life science education and research and is not a medical device. The study is being undertaken for research purposes only, and the researchers will not be able to provide any feedback regarding your ECG following participation. If you have any concerns about your heart and/or related health issues, you should contact your GP. Further information about ECG is available on the NHS website: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/electrocardiogram/*

*PARTICIPANT ADVISORY: SKIN SENSITIVITY TO ELECTRODE MATERIALS*

*We kindly request that participants refrain from volunteering for the study if they are aware of having sensitive skin to adhesives or the materials used in the electrodes. The electrodes used in the study are primarily composed of silver and silver chloride. If you have experienced skin reactions or allergies to these materials in the past, we advise against participation. Your comfort and well-being are our top priorities, and we appreciate your understanding in ensuring a safe and suitable research environment.*

*Please note that the template is for reference purposes only and should be adapted to fit the specific requirements of each study.
